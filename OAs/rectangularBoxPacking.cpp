// Q4: Check if you can store rectangles.

// You have two types of operations

// [0,a,b] store a rectangle of size axb
// [1,a,b] check if rectangle can be put in all the previous stored rectangles. You can rotate the rectangle by 90 degree. For example, [2,3] can be stored in [4,2]
// The question gives you a list of operations, return a list of true and false for all the check operation.
